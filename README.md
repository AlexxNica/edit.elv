# xiaq's collections of Elvish editor plugins

Here is a collection of editor plugins useful for
[Elvish](https://github.com/elves/elvish), the friendly and expressive Unix
shell.

These scripts always target Elvish HEAD. If they do not work for you, it is
usually because you are not running HEAD.

The recommended way to install this library is:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.elvish/lib/github.com/xiaq
git clone git@github.com:xiaq/edit.elv.git ~/.elvish/lib/github.com/xiaq/edit.elv
```

Usage comments in individual files assume that you have installed this library
in this way.
